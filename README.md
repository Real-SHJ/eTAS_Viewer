## What is this?
  eTAS is Digital Tachograph Analysis System
  
## Motivation
  According to the dangerous driving behavior statistical data provided by the traffic safety analysis system of the TS, the correlation between dangerous driving and accident rate can be grasped when comparing the dangerous driving behaviors of the business vehicles with the accident rates of the business vehicles. Therefore, the goal is to design smartphone applications that provide results to the general driver. Through this, we want to derive the safe operation of the driver.
  
## Project Goal
  In this study, data collected from sensors of smartphone are supplemented and modified for use through filters, and the orthogonality of smartphone is maintained and applied through calibration algorithm. Afterwards, the data is analyzed through a fast turn type determination algorithm, the data is stored in the device internal storage, and the analyzed result is transmitted to the cloud server through 3G, 4G, Wifi and provided to the driver in real time.
